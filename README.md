# Atlas

Atlas is a RESTful API that interacts with servers to deploy and maintain [Web Express](https://github.com/CuBoulder/express) at University of Colorado Boulder.

## Installing

See [Express_local](https://github.com/CuBoulder/express_local) for setting up a local development environment.

## Getting started

### Code
Code items should be created first. Required fields are: git URL, commit hash, Name, Version, and Type (core, profile, module, theme, library). Optional fields are: is_current (allows you to indicate the preferred version of a code item) and a tagging field.

#### Importing code from a JSON file

You can copy the JSON output of the code endpoint from an Atlas instance and import into another.
1. In the new instance, create a command item for `import_code` with the `query` set to the URL of the JSON file (GitHub gist has been tested). 
2. Patch the item (setting `single_server` is a good toggle) to run the import.

### Sites 
Site items are created with a 'pending' status and can be assigned a specific core and/or profile when created. If a core or profile is not specified, the 'current' version of the default is used.

## Features
* Chronological tasks run to keep a small number of instances available for assignment to end users.
* POST to create additional instances on demand.
* Available instances are replaced every night.
* Code, Site, and Command items are versioned.

## API
* Prefers to receive JSON encoded POST request.
* CRUD Web Express instances

## Configuration

Configuration is split between various files `config_*.py`. You need to create a `config_local.py` file and will most likely want to replace `config_servers.py`.

## Deploying Atlas

Currently we use a `git pull` deployment. When code is changed, you need to restart Celery, Celerybeat and Apache.

## Contributing

Pull requests are always welcome. Project is under active development. We want to make sure that Express doesn't become dependant on Atlas.
